## 🧪 Questionnaire Format

The app uses a JSON-based questionnaire structure.

### Example

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "title": "Linux Systems & DevOps Engineer Interview",
    "subtitle": "Evaluation questionnaire for recruiter or tech lead",
    "maxScorePerQuestion": 2
  },
  "grading": {
    "labels": {
      "2": "Correct",
      "1": "Partial",
      "0": "Incorrect"
    },
    "globalLevels": [
      { "min": 85, "label": "Very strong" },
      { "min": 70, "label": "Good" },
      { "min": 50, "label": "Average / needs improvement" },
      { "min": 0, "label": "Insufficient" }
    ]
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "section-linux",
      "title": "Linux",
      "description": "Core Linux administration questions",
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "q-linux-1",
          "label": "Linux fundamentals",
          "text": "Explain the difference between a process and a thread.",
          "expectedAnswer": [
            "A process has its own memory space",
            "Threads share the same process memory",
            "Threads are lighter than processes"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Load or create a questionnaire

You can either:

* import an existing JSON questionnaire
* create a new one from the built-in editor

### 2. Run the interview

For each question, the interviewer can:

* assign a score
* add notes
* review expected answers

### 3. Review the summary

The app computes:

* total score
* completion ratio
* overall level
* levels by domain
* weak areas

### 4. Export results

Export a CSV summary including:

* questionnaire metadata
* overall evaluation
* domain breakdown
* question-by-question notes

---

## 💾 Local Persistence

The current questionnaire is automatically saved in the browser using `localStorage`.

Stored keys:

```text
app.interview.config
app.interview.filename
```

This allows you to reopen the app and continue working from the latest saved state.

---

## 📤 Exported Data

### Questionnaire export

The editor exports the full questionnaire as a formatted JSON file.

### Interview export

The interview view exports a CSV file containing:

* questionnaire title and subtitle
* export timestamp
* overall score
* overall level
* per-domain summary
* detailed recap of each question
* recruiter notes
